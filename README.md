# Adoption???

This tool is for tracking levels of adoption of some
tool, practices or change that you want to track

As a starting point, this tool will support first tools
adoption and then it will have an abstraction.

The intent of this tools is to understand the impact
of the tools that support or enabling what you are pursuing
and also have awareness that the work doesn't end when the
implementation is up and running, but when the implementation
is been used by different people.

## Build the Binary

```sh
go build src/adoption.go
