Feature: labels support
  In order to filter only the adoptables on which I'm interested in
  As a visualizer of the levels of adoption
  I need to be able to filter adoptables by different criteria

  @labels
  Scenario: Assign labels
    Given there is a adoptable named Jenkata
    And the adoptable Jenkata is marked with team label as Ruabov
    And the adoptable Jenkata is marked with division label as Afeubaji
    When we ask for the adoptable Jenkata
    Then the list of the labels should have the length of 2
    And the list of the labels should contains to team=Ruabov
    And the list of the labels should contains to division=Afeubaji
